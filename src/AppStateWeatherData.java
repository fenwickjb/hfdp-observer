/*
  AppStateWeatherData.java

  This is a "boundary object" for our weather software system.
  
  Our boundary object connects the rest of our system with the
  device API. This way, the other parts of our system do not
  need to fret over device particulars. We offer a nice
  and easy to use set of methods.

  Based on Head First Design Patterns
